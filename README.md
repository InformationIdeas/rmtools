### RMTools
[github](https://github.com/tinbka/rmtools)

Collection of helpers for any need: strings, enumerables, Module... hundreds of bicycles and shortcuts you ever wanted to implement are here, optimized for performance.
Small dev library (constantly in progress): fast and smart logger, binding explorer, backtrace formatter, all are console-colored.
Started from basic classes, now it contains low-level helpers for ActiveRecord and makes LibXML more jQueryish.

RMTools is based on an opinion that some boiler-plate should be thrown away from Ruby making it more expressive with almost no (<< 10%) performance penalty:

`hash['id']` -> `hash.id`

`ary.map(&:id)` -> `ary.ids`

`ary.map {|h| h['id']}` -> `ary.ids`

`comments.posts.sorted_uniq_by_id.select_by_user_id(user_id).sum_points` -> `comments.map {|c| c.post}.sort_by {|p| p.id}.uniq_by {|p| p.id}.select {|p| p.user_id == user_id}.sum {|p| p.points}`

**Code less, do more!**

It's still randomly documented since it's just my working tool.

#### Main goals for 2.0

* Ruby code parser (StringScanner-based) reading array of loaded ruby-files and making accurate hash-table of defined methods {"Class#method" => "def ... end"}
* JSON-formatter for output ruby objects content in HTML form in order to inspect big objects using browser abilities

### CHANGES

##### Version 1.4.0

* Array
** Sacrificed a cleanness of the instance_methods namespace for a boost of meta-iterators (methods like `sort_by_sum_counts(n)`), read comments in /enumerable/array_iterators.rb
** New behaviour can be turned off by Array.fallback_to_clean_iterators!
** #avg and #avg_by for empty array now return 0
* Hash#method_missing
** Changed priority: first try to get value by a symbol key, then by a string key.
** Hash#<key>= stays the same: set value by a string key. This behaviour should not be changed, since string keys definition may have allready been used somewhere.
* Added Symbol#+, analogically of String#+
* ActiveRecord
** Added ::Base#with_same(<column_name>)
** Moved declarative.rb from Rhack project. ::Base.declarative is the method of making tables like in migrations but on the fly
* Fixed Kernel::require! (case with in-gem paths)
* The gem structure:
** Moved /b.rb into /core since #b is proved usability through some years
** Renamed /db -> /active_record
** Merged /ip into /conversions
** The gem is now producing in the bundle style: added Gemfile, rmtools.gemspec, etc

##### Version 1.3.3

* Added to Array: #sort_along_by, #indices_map, #each_two
* Enumerable#map_hash
* Range
* * Fixed #size for backward ranges
* * Fixed #x? and #-@ for neighbor numbers and non-integers in general
* * added XRange#x?
* * aliased #x? as #intersects?
* Class#__init__ accepts block, auto__init__ed Thread and Proc

##### Version 1.3.0

* Added ::ValueTraversal and ::KeyValueTraversal modules for treeish dir/enumerable search
* String
* * Cyrillic support: #fupcase, #fdowncase and instant up/down versions
* * #to_search, #squeeze_newlines, #recordize
* * key :js_caller to #parse for JS stacktrace lines as it given by stacktrace.js library
* Added AR::Base::boolean_scopes! and ::non_null_scopes!
* Added Object#ifndef for ivars caching
* Fixed bugs
* * Class#__init__ (case with nested classes)
* * AR::Base::select_rand (case with :where query)
* * ::rw and ::write (cases with encoding fail and non-string argument)
* Described the library and *marked down* this readme

##### Version 1.2.14

* Smartified Array bicycles: #index_where, #indices_where, #set_where, #set_all_where, #del_where, #del_all_where
* Added #arrange_by to Array enumerators
* Added AR::Base::enum for virtual "enum" type support
* Updated detecting of xml charset encoding for ruby 1.9
* Fixed bug with empty trace formatting and Array#get_args with non-equalable argument

##### Version 1.2.11

* Added Array#select_by and #reject_by pattern-iterators
* Fixed ActiveRecord::Base.select_rand
* Restricted RMTools.format_trace to use with Rails because of hard slowdown
* Updated Proc constants for ruby 1.9

##### Version 1.2.10

* Update String#parse:caller to parse ruby 1.9 "block level". Now block level processes in RMLogger and RMTools.format_trace
* lib/dev/traceback.rb now applies to ruby > 1.9 as well
* Support of Yajl or (if not installed) JSON for #to_json and #from_json. Overwrites ActiveSupport's ::encode and ::decode since they're so damn slow.

##### Version 1.2.8

* StringScanner#each changed to compare `cbs' keys with @matched by number in ruby 1.8 and by first character in ruby 1.9, since ?x in 1.9 returns string instead of a charcode
* Updated LibXML::XML::XPath to search elements with multiple classes

##### Version 1.2.7

* String#hl and #ghl: console-highlight pattern in string
* True#call and False#call in order to pass boolean values as callable argument
* ActiveRecord::Relation#any? and #empty?, ActiveRecord::Base.insert_unless_exist (using execute) and .select_rand 
* Added couple of handlers into Array#method_missing
* File.modify now can process files by glob-patterns and correctly use multiple gsub! inside passed block
* RMTools.read now can read from list of files in order
* Upped RMTools.timer accuracy
* Optimized Array#-, #+, #& and #| for when one of arrays is empty; added Array#diff
* Optimized Object#to_json and String#from_json: use JSON stdlib for ruby 1.9. Object#to_json_safe: timeout'ed conversion
* String#cut_line and #split_to_lines optimized for use in Ruby 1.9
* Removed String#bytes because it duplicate ruby 1.9 method
* static VALUE rb_ary_count_items moved from Array#count to Array#arrange
* Fixed Module#self_name
* RMTools::CodeReader is still unstable though

##### Version 1.2.0

* Renamed debug/ to dev/, slightly restructured lib/rmtools/ and require handlers: requrie 'rmtools' for common applications and 'rmtools_dev' for irb and maybe dev environment
* Slightly extended StringScanner
* Proof of concept: Regexp reverse (wonder if someone did it earlier in Ruby)
* Kernel#whose? to find classes and/or modules knowing some method
* Method code lookup over all loaded libs (it can't handle evals yet), see dev/code_reading.rb
* Coloring is now made by singleton `Painter' and have option for transparent coloring

##### Version 1.1.14

* Added caller level option (:caller => <int>) for Logger
* Fixed trace formatting (for sure for this time)
* Array iterator #sum_<method> now takes argument for #sum as first argument
* Completed Binding#inspect_env components

##### Version 1.1.11

* Fixed Hash#unify_keys for 1.9.2
* Speeded Array#uniq_by up
* Added some shortcut methods for ActiveRecord::Base

##### Version 1.1.10

* Deleted String#to_proc. It's anyway inconsistent and causes bug in ActiveRecord 3.0.5 Base#interpolate_and_sanitize_sql and potentially somewhere else
* Solved problem with String#sub methods in 1.9: that's associated with String#to_hash in some mystic way. #to_hash is now #to_params
* Some bugfixes for previous updates

##### Version 1.1.7

* Cosmetic fixes for txts here

##### Version 1.1.6

* Rewrited few functions
* Fixed bug with RDoc and RI
* Compatible with 1.9
* Binding#start_interaction and RMTools::Observer for debugging purposes
* To require any file from lib/rmtools now RMTools::require is used
* In order to not overload Rails apps initialization tracing is lightened and gem now may be also required as "rmtools_nodebug" and "rmtools_notrace"

##### Version 1.1.0

* Fixed some bugs
* Divided by semantics
* Compatible with ruby 1.8.7 (2010-08-16 patchlevel 302)

##### Version 1.0.0
